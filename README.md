# Shell setup

## Install brew (macos)

[Brew](https://brew.sh/index_fr) is a package manager for macos

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Install fish

```sh
brew install fish
```

## Install fisher

```sh

```

## Install iTerm

If you are using basic terminal on your mac you should install iTerm which is better built and looks better

```sh
brew install --cask iterm2
```

## Install oh-my-zsh

To get this render

```

## Install powerlevel10k

Clone this repository to use powerlevel10k and get a better render. If git is not already installed, go to this [page](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Now open `~/.zshrc` and set `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/`powerlevel10k"`

Quit iTerm and relaunch it

A special page will appear and you will have to select proposals to configure powerlevel10k

More info on [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) github page

Finally quit et relaunch iTerm again and see the result

If you want to edit the configuration :

```sh
p10k configure
```

You can also edit the code on `~/.p10k.zsh`

## Install Plugins

### Syntax Highlighting

```sh
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Enable the syntax highlighting :

```sh
source ./zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

# VSCode Terminal

After configuring oh-my-zsh, VSCode's terminal does not support powerlevel10k icons. So you have to go to vscode settings

Go to `Settings` and search `terminal font` and change the value to `MesloLGS NF`

For several months I used a Neovim config that I had created especially for web and mobile development. I recently switched to LunarVim which allows me to have additional features and better rendering

## Prerequisites

- ### Install lua

```
brew install lua
```

- ### Install cargo

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

## Installation (MacOS)

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunarvim/lunarvim/master/utils/installer/install.sh)
```

To config Neovim you have to go to `~/.config/lvim` and `~/.local/share/lunarvim` on MacOS

Edit `.zshrc` and add `PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin`

Now enter `lvim`to open lunarVim

<br/>

- This is the render with javascriptreact file

<br/>

- To open the integral terminal on your lunarVim window, press `ctrl` + `t`
